# Jaden Stock's Portfolio Website
I created this website in 2022 to have a space to display my future projects and ideas.

### 👷‍♂️ Did you design and build this website?
Yes. I designed and built the entire site by myself. However, I did gather design inspiration from the very talented Brittany Chiang's website https://brittanychiang.com

### 🚀 Can I use this for my own website?
Yes, but **make sure** to provide me with credit. Also keep in mind that the code is messy as I considered as I didn't intend to make it particularly readable by other developers.

### 🙋 I have a question or concern
Feel free to reach out to me about anything. My contact details are on my website.
